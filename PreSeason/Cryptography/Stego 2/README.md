#  Stego 2

### We have come across this image which we think may contain a flag. Try to make some sense out of it.

From the dymnasium practice problems, I guessed that the [Digital Invisible Ink Toolkit](http://diit.sourceforge.net/dirt.html) was used to hide a file in the image.

1. What is the algorithm used to encrypt the flag?
