# Basics

### This section involves finding information in pcap files. During the challenge I manually filtered and searched for the answers using Wireshark. I have scripted my answers using [PyShark](https://pypi.org/project/pyshark/) to more easily show the results. If you would like to see what it would look like in Wireshark, take the filter used in each solution and apply that manually, then search for the answer from there.


The pcap file can be found [here](Basics.pcap). A scripted solution for each question can be found in the [script](basics.py)

For the last question I was having trouble getting PyShark to cooperate so the filter can be found in the script file. Just use that filter and you will find the important packet.
