#  Python 1

### There is a hidden flag in this program. Can you find it?

1. What language is this program written in?
<details>
    <summary>Flag</summary>

        python...
</details>

2. What input will be successfully validated against this program?
Analyzing the source code, we see a list of numbers being compared to an xor'd input. Knowing that we can recove the desired input because of the nature of the xor.
```
given that c = a^b;
a = c^b = b^c
b = c^a = a^c
```
Using a python script the flag can be recovered.

        ```python
        vals = [ 130, 154, 136, 252, 131, 157, 155, 137, 252, 224, 229, 228, 231 ]
        print(''.join([chr(a^209) for a in vals]))
        ```
